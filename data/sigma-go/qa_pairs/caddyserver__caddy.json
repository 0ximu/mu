    "reasoning": "The answer correctly mentions that the AUpstreams module likely works with other components like ActiveHealthChecks and CircuitBreaker for load balancing and failover. However, the AUpstreams module itself is not directly referenced in the available nodes list, so it is considered an invalid node. The valid nodes referenced in the answer are ActiveHealthChecks, CircuitBreaker, LoadBalancing, and MultiUpstreams, which are likely relevant to the question."
